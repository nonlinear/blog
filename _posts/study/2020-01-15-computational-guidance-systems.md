| Machine Learning                       | Optimization                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| prediction, inference, learn from data | find max/min, human-in-the-loop, evaluation |

- Machine Learning as molecular gastronomy

| BayesOpt | Combinatorial Optimization                                 |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| max/min  | Interactive: the optimization happens in using the product |

#### BayesOpt

1. variables, what min and max
2. ask optmizer, given bounds above
3. have users evaluate the UI thru representative task (observation)
4. feed value metric of observation, back to 3

- distance, delay, decay, etc (metrics)

- Metrics

  - distance, delay, decay
  - brightness, contrast, saturation, color balance (3)

- optimal state

- Refining Visual Designs: 6 iterations

- Humans are good at comparative judging

- cultural considerations: if they dont share a culture, human-in-the-middle doesnt help.

- 3-20 inependent design dimensions

- 10-1000 of human observations

- diamond chart (definition/execution)

- a/b test dont tell a lot about optimal design dimension

Recommendations

- **visual metaphors:** images that convey a message symbolically
  - are both object identifiable?
  - are they integrated?
