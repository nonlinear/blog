- The Viola-Jones Algorithm (grayscale, find a nose, box travels thru the image)

  - "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features"

- Haar-like Features

  - edge, line, four rectangle
  - greater than 0.3
  - <img src="/assets/images/posts/Screen Shot 2019-12-10 at 10.38.31 AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-12-10 at 10.38.31 AM" style="zoom:50%; padding: 50px 0" />

  ## Integral Image

  - precalculates sums, so each area can be found with just 4 operations
  - makes raster vector (scale-free)
  - as long as it's rectangles

### Training Classifiers

- when training, scale the image DOWN
- mirror images
- non- images (same size, WITHOUT training to spot), for false positives, labeled
- [General framework for object detection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3766402_General_framework_for_object_detection)

## Adaboost

- Adaptative Boosting
- weak classifier (over 50%)
- strong classifier
- ensemble method (a lot of weak classifiers make a strong classifier)
-
