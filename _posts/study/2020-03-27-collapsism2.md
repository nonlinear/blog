Notes for the session 1 of [collapsism study circle](https://praxis.nyc/collapsism/)

- **Through the Looking Glass**
	- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm5o-ughyD8&t=1278s)
	- [slides](http://files.howtolivewiki.com/through_the_looking_glass_2010/Ireland%205.pdf)

- Poverty is collapse!!!
- What could we use instead of the State for managing our risk?
- **Climate change** and **financial collapse** share deep complexity and global scope
- **war** is the fundamental risk that governments are prepared to fight
	- not all risks look like warhow can we model risk?
- high-burn path, short term bias
- Democratically Elected Matriarchal Market Communism

#### Threat Models

| | scope | severity | complexity | source | odds |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| **Spilled Milk** | kitchen table | no use crying over it | point risk | humans | uncommon |
| **Crime** | individuals | theft to murder | point risk | humans | uncommon |
| **Asteroid Strike** | national to global | destruction | point risk   | physics | low |
| **Plague** | human race | substantial mortality | systems risk | other species | common in the past |
| **Climate Change** | global | severe disruption | systems risk | humans | ongoing |
| **Financial Collapse** | global economy | serious disruption | systems risk | humans | ongoing? |


- **scope:** inconvenience to destruction

- **complexity:** point/systems risk

- **source:** humans (individual, group, organization or state), other species, physical systems


### Main Groups

- **Green Wizards**
  - (john michael grear - arch druids)
  - individual experts socially sharing skills
  - Rapid roll-out of individual and group systems from skill banks
- **Transition Towns**
  - social cooperation for rising resource prices
  - communalizes the mnagement of supply chains for food and essential services
  - group & org strategy for maintaining supply chains & infrastructure
- **Dark Mountain**
  - change cultural reality,refresh our possibilities
  - finding the spaces to turn the ship
  - managing expectation by imagination to make room for adaptation


#### Managing Risks

1. Detect
2. Avoid
3. Mitigate
4. Recover

- **1 and 2:** threat-focused
- **3 and 4:** reaction-focused


### [State in a Box](http://guptaoption.com/8.state_in_a_box.php)

> unity of effort without unity of command

1. Municipal functions (water, power generation) are pushed **down** to the **household** level wherever possible.
2. State functions (identity databases which generate passports, issuing currency and so on for example) move **up** to **international** level.
3. This leaves a greatly simplified State

## Steps

1. Identify the systems that keep you alive
1. Identify threats to those systems
2. Avoid threats and mitigate risks 
1. Repeat until your are of concern is safe enough

## Problems

1. Isolation
	- you control very little of what you need to live
2. Competition
	- systems are centralized, efficient, cheap, brittle
3. Permission
	- status quo is mandated by same orgs failing to provide safe systems
4. Priority
	- guns or butter? cf solar panels or hospitals?

> VUCA: Volatile, uncertin, complex, ambiguous problems

# SCIM: Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps

## Identify the actors

- individuals
	- too hot
	- too cold
	- hunger
	- thirst
	- illness
	- injury
- groups
	 - communications
	 - transportation
	 - workspace
	 - resource control
- organizations
	- share map
	- shared plan
	- shared succession
- states/corporations
	- effective organizations
	- list of citizens
	- map of territories
	- jurisdiction
	- international recognition
