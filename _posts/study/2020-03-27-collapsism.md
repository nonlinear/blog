#### Threat Models

| | scope | severity | complexity | source | odds |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| **Spilled Milk** | kitchen table | no use crying over it | point risk | humans | uncommon |
| **Crime** | individuals | theft to murder | point risk | humans | uncommon |
| **Asteroid Strike** | national to global | destruction | point risk   | physics | low |
| **Plague** | human race | substantial mortality | systems risk | other species | common in the past |
| **Climate Change** | global | severe disruption | systems risk | humans | ongoing |
| **Financial Collapse** | global economy | serious disruption | systems risk | humans | ongoing? |
