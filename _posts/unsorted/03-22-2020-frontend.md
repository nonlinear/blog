## Aleksandr integrated message

ello, after reviewing 2.8 affiliation editor wireframes, I'd like to put my two cents ![ðŸ˜„](https://statics.teams.microsoft.com/evergreen-assets/funstuff/skype-emoticons-f/smile/default_20.png?v=4)

(And sorry for such a long post)

Currently, Author Services is not the best-looking website out there. As far as I know, a redesign is planned, but is not happening soon. Additionally, these new wireframes for Affiliation Editor look somewhat inconsistent with old AS styles - there's a difference between new features (they are more "colorful") and old AS look. And some of the colors that are used in new wireframes are questionable in terms of accessibility and color contrast. If we implement this as it is, then we'll have design inconsistency for some foreseeable future.

But I assume we all would like to have a better-looking product sooner. Over the last half a year we've been doing some standalone design related changes to AS, for example with My Profile Widget, or, more broadly, while making the site responsive. And we did quite a few changes to WPPAP as well.

Those our actions fit perfectly the idea of incremental redesign. In contrast to the full redesign, incremental redesign is a process that involves continuous improvements ideally based on data-driven decisions. Changes are smaller and new ideas are presented gradually.
 It doesnâ€™t involve a total overhaul of a website, rather just a single page or page section or even a small component.
 Just for information - some useful articles on the idea:

**Do you think it would possible to try to adopt such design workflow for the whole AS site - both old parts and new features?**

I suppose that this way we'll be able to quicker align the visuals of old functionality with new features while simultaneously moving towards a whole new (and better) look.

Instead of redesigning whole pages we can start from redesigning small UI pieces like buttons, checkboxes, inputs, pop-ups, smaller widgets, breadcrumbs and so on and move these small changes to production.
 ( That's similar to what some people call Atomic Design - http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/ )

 Such changes can be implemented separately. They are small and unlikely to break anything. And every single one of them makes a project slightly better. Accumulative effect of several small but well thought-out changes can give a significant improvement to the overall user experience...
