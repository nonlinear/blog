[Ten Simple Rules for Structuring Papers](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/088278v5.full.pdf) — *Focus your paper on one central contribution, which you communicate in the  title; write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know your work; stick to the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme; optimize your  logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism; tell a complete  story in the abstract; get across why the paper matters in the  introduction; communicate the results as a sequence of statements,  supported by figures, that connect logically to support the central  contribution; discuss how the gap was filled, the limitations of the  interpretation, and the relevance to the field; allocate time where it  matters: title, abstract, figures, and outlining; get feedback to  reduce, reuse, and recycle the story.*

### Conferences

#### An Event Apart

1. August 26–28, 2019 Chicago or October 28–30, Denver

	- $1,600?
	- [chicago](https://aneventapart.com/event/chicago-2019), [denver](https://aneventapart.com/event/denver-2019)
	- Danielle: AEA Chicago has a good agenda, but policy is you should be booking  travel more than 2 weeks ahead of time unless it’s an emergency, and  that’s short notice for next sprint.
         AEA Denver is similar but I notice there are fewer sessions on user research and integrating that insight into design.

3. [Circles](https://www.circlesconference.com/)

	- September 18-20 Texas
	- $575
	- Danielle: Circles isn’t focused nearly enough on the user.
  
4. [MidWest UX Conference](https://2019.midwestuxconference.com/schedule/)

	- October 10–12 Grand Rapids
	- $375 – $450
	- Danielle: Where is the agenda for Midwest UX?
	- Nicholas: I think the agenda is somewhat slim. Is there one you think it's important? If not, let's forget this one.
