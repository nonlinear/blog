# Other Publisher Workflows

Hi everyone,

I’m  CCing Shawn Chittle who will be joining us next Tuesday for 2 months,  until we get the full-time requisition filled. He comes with a ton of  experience in product design and leadership, most recently heading up design for Zillow.

First off, thank you for sharing. I love that the individual universities are consolidating this information, so researchers don’t need to know that  their institution is part of some bigger deal and find that info there. I love that the instructions are specific to the university. I wonder if we can canonize this approach in the  agreements somehow. This is also one of the more robust ones I’ve seen,  which is great.

Here’s my take on consolidating. I’ll also find a place to stash the workflow  info so we don’t lose it, unless there’s an existing place that should  live?

**AIP**

- 6 journals, none fully OA
- Manual process and authors need to notify AIP about their affiliation. 
- “AIP is working on automization of the workflow”

**ACS**

- All ACS journals, including OA
- CC-BY license
- Agreement covers about 70% of publishing output; it sounds like organizations  will need to pay for more publishing output when the agreement runs out
- No automated workflow yet. ACS is finding articles that are accepted after Jan 1, reporting to the consortium, then individual universities  verify. 


 **CUP**

- It sounds like all hybrid and OA journals
- License signing is via RightsLink
- LU directs authors to enter “Lund University” in the “Affiliation discount” field, which waives the APC

Here’s something I found online which references the RightsLink UI if you want to take a peek. While it is a bit confusing, I see merit in how they’re handling institutional matching – one big scrolling box inline that shortens as you refine, with the “can’t find  your institution” link to the right. I wonder if that would reduce user  error.

**Cogitatio Press**

- All 4 journals
- They don’t make a distinction about corresponding vs. co author, they just note authors
- Authors must submit using their institutional email address (@lu.se) – this  makes the bold assumption that the submitter’s affiliation represents  all affiliations, or rather forces someone affiliated with Lund to be the submitter

**De Gruyter**

- Weirdly, LU says 90% Discount on Hybrid, 30% discount on pure OA, but DG’s own  page on Hybrid says your institution will cover the APC – anyone reading that differently?
- They directly link to a Sweden-specific page on De Guyter’s side: https://www.degruyter.com/page/1770
- CC-BY or CC-BY-NC
- Universities must actively subscribe to the hybrid journal being published in; 8 institutions have the full collection
- Corresponding author only
- This page says instructions are on each journal’s “Submission of  Manuscripts” page, but then each journal I looked at references more  information at these generic pages, so I can’t actually find the instructions for authors on how to specify their affiliation

**ECS**

- The link goes directly to an ECS page and I can’t find the specific detail for these deals

**Elsevier**

- Journals in the ScienceDirect Freedom collection, and journals from Cell Press. Many journals are excluded.

- Their workflow is like ours. “In the platform the author states the  affiliation and can also add other information. Based on the stated  affiliation, the current options for publishing are shown and the author can choose Gold OA”

- Journey screenshots here: https://www.ub.lu.se/en/sites/ub.lu.se.en/files/publicering_under_elsevier_avtalet.pdf

- - I  like the screen with “getting ready” instructions including noting that a PO or tax exemption info may be requested if applicable
  - It looks like they, too, are instructing authors to focus on institution and not department. 
  - The rest of the workflow is very similar to ours; enter coauthor details,  enter funder info, select OA, select license, select ownership, review  terms and accept. They have also chunked it into distinct screens. I’d like to review some of the instructional copy they have and see if they’ve figured out a better way to explain some  of the thorny concepts, since it’s best if we have familiarity and  convergence when we can. 

**IOP**

- 50 hybrid journals. You still need to apply for APC funding for fully OA.
- They request the corresponding author state affiliation AND use lu.se email address at submission 

**IWA**

- 25% discount; they have OA for books which is covered as well
- They use RightsLink
- Workflow here, similar to CUP
   https://iwaponline.com/open_access/pages/institutional_waivers 

**Karger**

- All journals and unlimited OA
- Corresponding author affiliation only
- Affiliation is specified at submission
- Workflow here, page 10 (P.S.: yikes): https://www.ub.lu.se/en/sites/ub.lu.se.en/files/karger_author_workflow.pdf

**OUP**

- Limited number of articles, covers 75-85% of expected articles
- All Hybrid. OA and 41 titles from full collection excluded.
- Their workflow is almost the reverse of ours: Upon acceptance, corresponding  author gets link to “Author services site.” After selecting CC-BY,  author goes to APC page, where they can pick their institution from a discount list.
- Institution independently verifies before article is published.
- I found some screenshots here: https://www.embl.de/services/library/open-access-information/publisher-schemes/oup/ - the OA account info dominates the OA screen and is seen by everyone

**RSC**

- Unlimited
- Corresponding authors
- Hybrid, not OA. Must apply to central fund for OA.
- No clear details about how they are determining eligibility, but on RSC’s  own page it requests they use their institutional email and state their  affiliation in their manuscript, so it must be a combination of email and a manual production process to invite  authors: https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/open-access/read-and-publish/

**SAGE**

- Unlimited in hybrid, 20% discount for OA; 12 journals excluded
- SAGE is launching a new management system in 2020 which is post-acceptance.  They claim this is where authors can state that the article is part of a publisher agreement, but they also claim that upon acceptance they will be notified that the article can be  published with OA. So, not clear when/how they will determine  eligibility. TBD.
- Lund University does not verify author affiliation – I wonder what was negotiated, then.

**SPIE**

- They request that authors submit their paper and state their affiliation including department, and use their university email
- There is additionally an institutional dropdown in the submission process to designate that they are part of the agreement. 

**Springer Compact**

- Hybrid journals
- Corresponding author must be affiliated with Lund and state it as an affiliation (presumably at submission)
- Authors are requested to use lu.se email
- Limited to article type
- Once your article is accepted, Springer will ask you to confirm affiliation  to Lund University. Springer and the institution then verify  eligibility. 

**Springer Nature Fully OA**

- BMC, Springer Open Journals, Nature Comms, Scientific Reports, and Palgrave Communications
- LU-affiliated corresponding authors will be identified when submitting a manuscript. 
- Authors are advised to only enter Lund University to facilitate identification. LU also verifies affiliation.

**T&F**

- Cap of 1450 APCs
- T&F core content only – 2,300 hybrid journals. No fully OA
- Affiliation stated at submissions; authors also asked to use lu.se email address.

**Final thoughts:**

A lot of publishers are providing sub-optimal means to identify authors, and  we’re among the best at helping and checking to make sure eligible  authors get through. We’ll be on par with Elsevier after this release which is good news in this case. Hooray for us!

I  don’t think the hybrid description of the workflow on LU’s page is as  clear as others’. We don’t advise explicitly that the best way to ensure eligibility is to have the affiliated corresponding author submit, and to provide accurate institutional information at  submission. The instructions can also confuse someone because not every  author is going to get an email showing they are covered. It would be  best to make it clear that they will have the opportunity to clarify institutional affiliations after being invited to sign their  license. I’d also encourage authors to use their institutional @lu.edu  email from the et-go because that is just another way we can make sure  they are seeing notification at the right time.

What  I’m reading from a lot of these is that institutions are independently  verifying eligibility of articles before the article gets published. I  can only guess that in that model with something like OUP, they are getting a lot of authors who claim affiliation but  don’t qualify, and the institution needs to review before it gets  covered and published. This seems like it could really slow the  publishing process down (waiting on institutions) and require a lot of back-tracking for authors who mistakenly (or intentionally)  claim eligibility when they are not eligible. On the other hand, I bet  they don’t get a lot of authors who are mistakenly paying for their own  APCs. Pros and Cons.
