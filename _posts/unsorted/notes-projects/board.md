### Initial Preso

- augmented table with projector camera and computer 
- computer vision: reacts to objects and gestures
- it's tactile (embodied cognition)
- for communities, not markets
  - easily found materials
  - comunal, socialization reduces learning curve (we learn by mimicking)
  - open source, zero knowledge (no cloud. find better term)
  - it's local, secure (the door is the security)
- case studies
  - learing machinery
  - topology, urbanism
  - notes, collective decisions
  - mind maps

## Business Model

- Grants
  - [Mozilla Research](https://research.mozilla.org/research-grants/)
  - Recurse Center: [$10,000 Fellowships for women (trans and cis), trans, and non-binary programmers  ](https://www.recurse.com/blog/149-10000-fellowships-for-women-trans-non-binary-programmers)
  - Crowdsourcing 
- crowdsourcing/patreon

### Header

- module title, version
- project title
- whos in it
- History: provide context (how?)
- Filters used

## Stress testing of different devices/combos

- crowdsourced
- onboarding with logical decision tree
- making a cut of sales?
- Initial questions:
  - layout: board or slide
  - platform: main, other or roll your own?

# Modules

Modules have versions, and interactions with other modules (mostly "share" functions)

### Post-it/Areas

- persistent
- history (previously on)
  - revert
  - diff
  - fork

## Layout challenges

- Every screen is a graph (legend, data visualization, etc), understandable by any passerby
- header
- different point of views
- Token: [view figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/IoKlC923UTYvqbLyPe6dapH7/authentication?node-id=0%3A1)
  - authentication
  - keyboard
  - anything that needs privacy
  - Voting?

## Things to detect

- gestures
  - one tap, move
  - two taps, radial menu
- game cards
- QR codes
- things people care with them:
  - coins
  - cards
  - keys
  - pens, lighters

## Platforms

platforms are different installations of boards. each platform has:

- its own database
- theme (animations, decorations)
- Modules and versions

advanced users can ask platform to reveal its contents (about this Mac?)



## Authentication

Can users carry their identity with them, and load on board? on their phone?

- how do they fold it back, remove from table?
- pseudonyms, which one to use per board
- can users carry some personalizations, like gestures, animations, decorations, even entire dbs (making them admins?)

## Auth vs platform vs module

- how to keep it balanced, open?
- security issues

### Article checklist

- define audience
- provide context
  - what are you presenting
  - which phase? show previous phases
- make it as much rich media as you can
- define next steps
- define audience
- how to promote?
