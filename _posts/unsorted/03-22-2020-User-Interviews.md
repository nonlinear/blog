# User Interviews

### Josh Nelson

- "so generic", wiley family
- captca, easy to read
- password conditions, highlights?

- "i am liking this drag and drop"
- autoparse
- got email and noticed
- comparing resume sites (autoparse is bad)
- dismisses popup overall (overconfident)
- curious about error, 
- failsafe is "well done"
- failsafe converts symbols!!!
- authors should scroll to selection

- cant autofill only affiliation, "no affiliation" is a choice.
- Prevent google chrome autofill (or dismiss it)

- "why are you suggesting" reviewer
- Abstract is wonky on final review
- whole file name? pdf preview

### Jordi de Batlle

- adapting format to journal is quite time consuming (2 hours)

- "main document" on top. redeisgn article type menu
- 2 visions: with or without figures

## design proposals

- match affiliations, match 1, 2, no match (suggest as sub option)

- Confetti page, survey more defined
- Keywords, focus on NUMBER of keywords (or optional)
- item with border on hover only, with side bar
