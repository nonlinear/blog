[What the World Will Look Like After Coronavirus - VICE](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxekvw/the-world-after-coronavirus-healthcare-labor-climate-internet)

- Free and universal healthcare ("healthcare is a basic human right" -B. Sanders)
- Abolish ICE and prisons ("ICE is now a public health hazard")
- Protect and empower labor ("Without these protections, everyone's safety and health is put at risk")
- A healthier climate ("If the 2008-09 financial crash is any  indicator, carbon could shoot right back up as soon as the crisis is  over")
- Fast, accessible broadband ("Community owned/operated broadband  networks, long demonized and even prohibited by law are looking better  than ever")
- Smash the surveillance state ("This pandemic mustn't be used to infringe on the civil liberties and privacy of millions")
- Billionaire wealth ("They're sending people to work while jetting off to luxurious doomsday bunkers, getting Covid-19 tests while normal  people can't, and also singing 'Imagine' from bucolic getaways.")
- Public transit that works ("Congress is poised to prioritize bailing  out airlines and the cruise industry before it takes a look at public  transit")
- The right to repair ("Right-to-repair has become a matter of life and death.")
- Science for the people ("We were caught flat-footed by a fixation on 'innovation' and lack of public options")
