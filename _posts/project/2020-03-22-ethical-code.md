Here are my notes, then zee notes, for zee to consolidate and announce.

#### Audience

1. Palantir as company and developers
2. non-developers (use laymen terms) 
3. maintainers 
   1. software is in use by palantir
   2. not on palantir and want to protect themselves

#### Funnels

1. maintainers with software in use
   1. change the licensing: point to the research
   2. pledge on README (badge)
   3. donate money to a group that opposes ICE (README that they did)
2. maintainers unsure if they are used by palantir
   1. github oauth to detect if (alerts? phase 2? discuss)
      1. if yes, check "maintainers with software in use"
      2. if no, how to protect yourself from it
3. dev non-mantainers
   1. raise an issue on ethical license (padding with warnings, how to behave)
   2. donate money to a group that opposes ICE (if you can afford)
   3. donate to repo (better contrast for repos on pledge)
4. non-dev
   1. dashboard, graphs, progress, bird-eye view: explain what they are seeing (phase 2?)

#### Arguments to expose

- open source traditionless
- overworked, underpaid maintainers (donation, thank you for your service, etc)

#### Tech to discuss 

- flags on CTAs so we can measure progress (of donation, of issues raised, etc)
- proxy mesure for repo popularity: reveal power curve, some repos are better than others (likes, follow, activity. it PROBABLY exists somewhere)
- dashboard
