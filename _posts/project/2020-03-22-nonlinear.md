# TODO

- why is config.yml info not on head?
- cover on frontmatter
   - find a default cover per category
   - ensure cover appear on open links (failsafe for animated gif)
- check unsorted
- ~~get processing npm things~~
- ~~move processing stuff~~
- categories as a loop
- project, status
- find a variable font
- ~~status: public, draft, private~~
- RSS shouldn't show private or draft
- ~~atext for new file~~
- ~~atext for frontmatter~~
- design this mofo
- p5js inside div, not floating around
- data using jekyll
- js assets, how?
