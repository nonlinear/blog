# Automating things

I'm upstate, away from home and office, and feeling very frazzled coz I depend on my cues to shift states. Without it, I get confused, forgetting:

1. That I should switch states
2. What to do to switch states

I am VERY GOOD at muscle memory, tho. So I decided to create some simple triggers to switch easily. I know I'll eventually switch without my conscious decision, and that's how I roll.

First, I'm on a mac and use:

1. [alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for well, everything. everything is just a `âŒ˜-space` away (I disable spotlight). 
1. [atext](https://www.trankynam.com/atext/) for global replacements. Like, any time (and anywhere) I type `-go`, replace it with `whatever`. 

There are other options, like alfred built-in snippets, but it's paid and it doesn't accept variables. [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) is a good alternative but expensive, and frankly, atext does the job.

## Settings

I enabled terminal integration on alfred, so typing `>` at the start of my query means "run it on terminal instead"

I also change "Prefer tabs when opening documents" as "Always" on system preferences > dock.


## First trigger: `-work`

typing `>-work` and hitting enter then opens all different tools that need my attention: my jira tickets, work inbox, work calendar,
