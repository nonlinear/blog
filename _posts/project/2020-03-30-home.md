[Ten Simple Rules for Structuring Papers](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/088278v5.full.pdf) â€” *Focus your paper on one central contribution, which you communicate in the  title; write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know your work; stick to the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme; optimize your  logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism; tell a complete  story in the abstract; get across why the paper matters in the  introduction; communicate the results as a sequence of statements,  supported by figures, that connect logically to support the central  contribution; discuss how the gap was filled, the limitations of the  interpretation, and the relevance to the field; allocate time where it  matters: title, abstract, figures, and outlining; get feedback to  reduce, reuse, and recycle the story.*
