Big Shoulders for the City of Chicago

updated as of 08/07/2019

added Optical Size axis, so the family is now 16 fonts: Big Shoulders Text (in 8 weights) and Big Shoulders Display (in 8 weights).

the Variable Font family name is Big Shoulders; styles appear in a style submenu with text and Display interleaved.

the OTF and TTF family names are split into Big Shoulders Text and Big Shoulders Display; you’ll see both with an 8-weight submenu, from Thin to Black.

use Big Shoulders Text for sizes up to 72 point. use Big Shoulders Display for anything larger.

added case-sensitive diacritics—this means uppercase and small caps forms have vertically shorter diacritics so that you can stack lines of uppercase tighter and keep an even line

added a full set of small caps, including all diacritics & punctuation

added .sinf and .sups (scientific inferiors and superscript)

tweaked angled accents (grave, acute, double grave, Hungarian umlaut, circumflex, ) to be steeper and shorter so that lowercase characters can pack tighter together.
