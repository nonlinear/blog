Pushes your `./dist` folder only (as root) to the `gh-pages` branch.

Your published page is always `{username}.github.com/{repository}`

## Usage

- To publish your distribution file, just run `gulp publish`

## Limitations and troubleshooting

- It only works if your distribution folder is `./dist` (as default)
- If somehow it breaks, delete folder `.publish/` and try again
- If for any reason you need to rename your distribution folder, check [root](Root) instructions.
