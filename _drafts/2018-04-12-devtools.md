to do:
1. more stuff on sources panel, check link.
2. the little 3d thing, how to get it?
1. separate things per panels, explain command menu is limited

main ones:
- open inspector `control+shift+I`
- `control+shift+p` (like sublime text) opens command menu
- `control+shift+c` to select any object on the page
- search for anything with `control+shit+f`

on elements, `control-click` to view

Perfomance is the Art of Avoiding Work

to test perfomance:
go to `network` panel,  on little camera and reload so you have screenshots.

sniff around
- check load time on `network` and check for
  - broken assets
  - bottlenecks (if js can be async, make it async)
  - right click on asset to "block url" and review performance
- check file structure on `sources`
- `audit` the page (it takes a while) to check on low hanging fruits
- show `animations`, reload page, then click thumbnal to view animations, durations

theoretically you can capture node screenshot to get whatever you selected in png formate (it downloads automatically) but crop came all wrong for me, so take it with a grain of salt.

numbers: up and down change range by 1.
alt: change by * .1
shift: change by * 10
control: change by * 100

$0 - last object selected
$1 - second last object selected
$2 - third last object selected
...
$_ - previous evaluation

add will-change or animate with transform 3D: it pulls object to its own layer, a composite layer, so there's no repainting below.
